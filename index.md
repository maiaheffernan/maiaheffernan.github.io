This site is home to my updates regarding my research progress for the M<sup>2</sup>0<sub>2</sub> (Measuring and Modeling O<sub>2</sub> in Puget Sound) Project.
My aspect of this work focuses on the observations of flow, dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, fluorescense, and other physical properties in Penn Cove.
This blog will be tracking my progress all throughout my PhD with (roughly) weekly posts.
