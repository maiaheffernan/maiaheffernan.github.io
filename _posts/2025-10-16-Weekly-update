# Weekly research update
## Thursday, 10/9 - Thursday 10/16

This week was a bit hectic for me in terms of balancing homework and research, and homework ultimately won in the end. So, the updates here are going to be mostly a summary of the M2O2 meeting this afternoon and my plan from this week.

We spent a fair amount of time thinking about instrument placement in the M2O2 meeting today.
