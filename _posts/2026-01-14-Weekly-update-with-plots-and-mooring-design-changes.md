# Weeky update on plots, progress, and mooring design (oh my!)

This past week has been full of starting some more quality control and making a new round of plots! Also Jim and I have been discussing changes to the mooring design. I will walk through the details of all this below.

### Quality control

The big thing I am taking on this week is visually checking the tow-yo CTD data for erroneous or weird-looking data points, especially at the surface and bottom, and looking at the SWIFT Signature1000 data for any occurences of bad averaging for the burst ensembles. 
So far I am just openeing all of this and digging into it so there is not much to report there. I am hesitant to show any plots of more data before having finished this QC, so I am hoping that I will have more by next week! 

### Writing

I threw together this very high-level sampling plan and details to send to King County: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OOkIBGu1dn3sWlueZLWX78R9g_jwJ8Hk/edit

I have been getting great edits from everyone, and Sam and David from WWU have also included some information about their sampling plan which is great! I am hoping to send this off to Jim Simmons this week. I want to check in about this one last time before I do: **After incorporating all the suggested edits, is there more I should do for this before we send it?**

### Another plot

I know I said that I would not make any more plots until I am done with QC, but I wanted to include this temperature/salinity plot I made that is colored by dissolved oxygen concentration.
