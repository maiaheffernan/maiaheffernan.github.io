# Winter break updates and my goals for Winter Quarter 2026

I do not have any new content to share as I did not get much done over the winter break. The most recent update is a draft of a cruise report detailing our work and initial takeaways from the December recon mission. I have lots of comments on the sidelines for myself to specify future work, and I have not done a heavy-duty editing pass to improve clarity and consistent tone. Just be warned if you go in there looking for a super polished and publishable document. I will be refining this in these first couple weeks as I improve my plots and have more time to draw connections between patterns we see. Here is the link (it is also in the Penn Cove Drive): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XHWbx5WPq_2Uef7kjG43LArT2Pbr-K9EQyou-iMbDko/edit?tab=t.0

This is the only new content I have. The rest of this document outlines my goas for this quarter.

## Goals and plans for the quarter

I have several large goals, but I am confident that my focus on my research and independent study this quarter will get me through a lot of this work.
They are outlined below:

#### 1) Process and have a story with data from the December recon mission to Penn Cove by the end of the quarter.
- This involves some QAQC, continued creative plotting, going back through the notes from my stats class during my master’s and incorporating those practices if applicable, etc.
- This will look like a large final report of some key figures and takeaways by the end of the quarter. I want to have a picture in my mind about the velocity trends at different tidal heights and stages, how these trends interact with the temperature, salinity, and DO concentration trends, and any spatial intuition we glean from this work.
- I am doing this because it will be essential to helping plan where to place the moorings in the spring for the long-term deployment. Also, having a baseline repository of nice code and analysis practices will be helpful for me down the line when I start working with the larger datasets from the long-term mooring.
- I will include any new figures in weekly blog posts for updates in the M2O2 meetings
- I will condense a lot of this work into my report for King County at the end of this quarter. 

#### 2) Finalize mooring design and placements
- This is a bit more of a pressing timeline because we have to get things ordered and constructed. This should be completed by March 1st at the latest unless anyone else suggests a more urgent timeline.
- Each plot I make will have a section of analysis in which I write my thoughts about how we can best capture any trends with the mooring design based on what we are seeing and if there are any spatial trends that would be helpful to capture based on the initial transect profile data. 
- As needed, I will make changes to the Google Map plan based on the feedback from M2O2 meetings. 
- I want to make sure that I am emailing folks who might be interested/able to help: Alex Fischer, Swinomish fisheries folks, Drew Lucas, Susan Allen and Mike Brett.
- This quarter I want to have another all-project team meeting including Susan, Mike, and Sam and maybe David about a finalized plan where they get one more chance to give some thoughts.

#### 3) Read at least 2 papers/week
- I have an ongoing paper summary sheet where I will summarize the findings and my own thoughts about what I read. This will be constantly updated.
- I plan to focus on the information about estuarine processes that will be important for drawing conclusions about where to place moorings and any instrumentation uses or reviews that will be helpful for thinking about how we can best utilize our sensors.
- It would be awesome to actually start up the reading group! I will send out an invite to Aurora, Dakota, and Tia and anyone else who wants to join :)  

#### 4) Get set up with Live Ocean and Python
- This is fulfilling my dropped ball from last quarter. By the end of this quarter I would like to be able to do a mooring extraction from the model on my own and also have worked through the test estuary practice that Parker has set up. 
- I want to get somewhat comfortable with Live Ocean sooner rather than later so I can start using it as a tool if need be!
- I am also planning to do the rest of my analysis in Python this quarter. This is going to be a large initial life but I am hoping that it will pay off further down the line in the quarter and beyond. I will have to do some integration of existing MATLAB scripts but that is why I am only taking one class this quarter.
- I also plan to become proficient with Github this quarter. I will be saving all of my scripts into a repository on Github and plan to be efficient at pushing and pulling and integrating things in the LO_user realm. This organization will really help me now and down the line as well.

#### 5) Create the habit of this daily/weekly virtual planner and goal trackers
- This Google Doc will become very long but will be so beneficial to reference as I work through small and large goals throughout the quarter.
- Also, a lot of my thesis writing and analysis was based on my analyses on new plots that I made in a similar document in my master’s. This was so helpful to not have to reinvent the wheel!
- I will have consistent weekly blog posts this quarter that will be sent out to the M2O2 group the night before or morning of each meeting. This weekly summary of my daily progress throughout the week will be helpful for me to write and re-write my thoughts and analyses as I go. I have learned I need to sit with things for a long time and a few different times to make meaningful connections between my work. This will help with that.   



These are my overarching goals for the quarter. The minute work to achieve these goals will likely evolve as I go, but having this baseline to come back to will be really helpful for me. At the end of each week I want to take stock of if/how long I spent on work for each of these goals to help me stay on top of all these different moving parts and ensure that I am actively working towards them. I will detail my progress in these posts! 

That's all for now :)
