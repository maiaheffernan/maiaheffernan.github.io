# Winter break updates and my goals for Winter Quarter 2026

I do not have any new content to share as I did not get much done over the winter break. The most recent update is a draft of a cruise report detailing our work and initial takeaways from the December recon mission. I have lots of comments on the sidelines for myself to specify future work, and I have not done a heavy-duty editing pass to improve clarity and consistent tone. Just be warned if you go in there looking for a super polished and publishable document. I will be refining this in these first couple weeks as I improve my plots and have more time to draw connections between patterns we see. Here is the link (it is also in the Penn Cove Drive): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XHWbx5WPq_2Uef7kjG43LArT2Pbr-K9EQyou-iMbDko/edit?tab=t.0
