# December recon trip and some initial plots
### A brief report for the M2O2 meeting on Dec 12, 2025

As you all know, Jim, Tia, Amy, and I went out on a short(ish) data sampling day tip in Penn Cove last Thursday, December 4th. Our overarching goals for this "recon trip" was to gain some initial insights and physical understanding of Penn Cove to better prepare for the larger 6-month deployment that will begin this spring. In particular, we are interested in these initial questions:
1. Is there north-south asymmetry in velocity at different tidal stages on the "fence" of Penn Cove, which is the line we have drawn from Blowers Bluff (north) to Long Point (south) that we believe defines the entrance to the inlet.
2. Is there density stratification in Penn Cove? If so, when and what does this look like?
3. Are there differences in flow at the top and bottom of the water column, particularly on this fence?
4. Can we gain any initial insights about DO levels in Penn Cove?

Before I get into addressing some of those questions, I first want to walk through what we did and how the day unfolded. Huge thanks to Jim and Amy for getting the boat, the R/V Echo, to the Port of Everett (POE) on Tuesday!

We wanted to catch as many different tidal stages as we could in a reasonable working timeframe, so we left POE at 05:20 and arrived at Penn Cove at 06:30. From here, we deployed the first swift at the southern swift mooring site and took a CTD cast with the Castaway before moving on to deploy the second swift at the northern site. Once that was deployed we took antother Castaway cast there.

By 07:55 we had started our first transect through around Penn Cove. We started at the north end of the fence at Blower's Bluff, transected south across the fence and then turned into Penn Cove at the south end of the fence at 08:10. Here is a map of our transect path:

As we were transecting, we were taking continuous pole-mounted ADCP and CT readings. These instruments were on all day. As we were transecting we were also taking continual CTD casts with the RBR Concerto that measured conductivity, temperature, depth, and DO. All in all throughout the entire day we got over 500 casts!
